There is a trend that clearly shows the behavior of the passengers over time. Over a single year and for a whole decade, the variation of passengers every month is similar. A drop can be seen every year in February, followed by a jump in March. The number of passengers increased steadily until July and August. Once the peak is reached, the number of passengers decreases, with some variations around October and December. It is also worth noting that the number of passengers has kept on increasing every year.

The above airlines have had the most passengers over the years. United Airlines clearly tops the ranking. The latter airline's data is divided into two parts: pre-07/01/2013 and post-07/01/2013. It had reached a peak of 18,209,232 passengers in 2015. The remaining airlines completing the top 5 are all local airlines, such as Delta Airlines, Virgin America, etc. Starting in 2007, the number of passengers using Virgin America steadily increased to be the second most-used airline in 2015 (4,164,013), after United Airlines.

13,091,776 and 8,084,752 passengers, respectively, over a decade. South America is the least visited region by Americans, with only 250,741 passengers.
